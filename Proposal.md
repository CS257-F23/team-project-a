# **American Space Agency Planetary System Information Registry (ASAPSIR)**

We will be using The NASA Exoplanet Archive.

**Summary of dataset:** The NASA Exoplanet Archive is a publicly available catalog of data, supporting the search for and characterization of extra-solar planets and their host stars.

2-4 interesting/meaningful ways that a user could interact with the data
- Create an interface that synthesizes exoplanet data in order to   allow users to quickly view planets based on desired parameters (i.e. potentially able to support extraterrestrial life).
 
- Use the data about the semi-major axis of each planet (average distance from planet to its star) to determine what planets are in the “Goldilocks Zone” and are thus potentially habitable. Allow the user to explore a list of these planets.
- Allow the user to input the name of a planet and view an easily digestible amount of pertinent information about said planet.

## **Team Contract**

Our goals for this project are: Learn how to work as a team to design meaningful software that effectively engages users with various subsets of data from a larger overarching database. 

**Team Members and Strengths:**

Allie:
- Organization
- Good note-taker
- I’m good at scheduling things and staying on top of deadlines

Jack: 
- Communication 
- Learning new things, especially via reading
- Open-minded, really strive to solve problems collaboratively 

Nicholas:
- Good listener and communicator 
- Logistics 
- Quick learner

Palmy:
- Problem-solving skill
- Teamwork! Collaborate effectively

**Team Member Roles:**
We will divide up this project and capitalize on each member's strengths by following the following roles:

Palmy - Mission Control: Coordinate team missions (sprints) and communications between team members.

Allie - Professional Astrophysicist: Rationalize the relevance of planetary system data presented, as it pertains to the specific use cases. 

Jack - ISS Engineer: Handle user-facing challenges, and safety concerns (debugging). 

Nicholas - Full-stack Cosmonaut:  Jack-of-all-trades, mainly responsible for ensuring code is well-documented and exploring the depths of data offered in the exoplanet archive.

In addition, each team member will be a part of the space crew, a base role that includes responsibilities to collaborate and write efficient code.

**Specific Features Which Team Members Will Focus On**

Palmy - User interface (command line and flask accessibility)

Allie - Goldilocks planet and habitable planet features

Jack - Tests and additional responsibilites as required

Nicholas - Load data and get planet info features

**Team Rules**

Communication:
We plan to coordinate out-of-class meetings on a week-to-week basis as a whole group in order to review progress and discuss. As our schedules will vary throughout the weeks (Nicholas in particular has a constantly changing play-rehearsal schedule) we will be flexible in our meeting times. 
In addition, we will communicate via text and before class for clarifications and questions as needed.
We will be respectful of each other’s time, responding to both logistical and technical questions in a timely manner and being accommodating to schedule changes. Though we plan to code individually, we will be in constant communication about what each of us is working on to avoid two people repeating the same task.

Participation:
For each team deliverable, we will discuss what we need to achieve and assign a task to each team member based on their role, making sure to divide work in an equitable manner. We will ensure that each team member participates meaningfully by expecting team members to complete their assigned work on time, and communicate about any expected delays.

Decisions:
We will make team decisions by decorum. If there is no unanimous consensus on a decision, we will have a discussion until we (hopefully) reach agreement. We expect that, for the sake of being both thoughtful and decisive, in the case of a 3-1 split, the majority will figure out a way to incorporate or address the minority member’s concern, and said member will acquiesce to the majority’s wishes. For 2-2 split, we expect that a prolonged conversation will eventually yield an answer, either by one of the groups allowing the other’s idea to proceed or by the four of us finding a third solution that incorporates both ideas. Minor issues can and should be resolved over text, while larger problems will be discussed in-person.

Conflicts:
We will deal with inner team conflict by having open and honest discussions. After a potential cool-down period, we will explain where each of us is coming from and strive for a solution-based approach to any problems that arise. We will attempt to leave personal grievances out of it (though we don’t think any will come up) and find compromises that everyone, at the least, can live with.
